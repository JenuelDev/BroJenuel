###  👔 About Me

In 2016, I made a strategic shift from my studies in criminology to pursue a career in Information Technology, where I discovered the intricate and captivating field of software development.

Fast-forward to today, with over 5 years of professional experience as a software developer, I have consistently engaged in the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of software development, collaborating with fellow coding enthusiasts and contributing to some truly remarkable products.

I take pride in my attention to details, meticulously examining even the smallest elements that could potentially snowball into significant issues. Whether it's ensuring code efficiency or perfecting a recipe, I believe that thoroughness in the details is essential for overall success for building scalable, engaging, & accessible digital experience.

When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually playing a guitar even though I'm not a pro in it, trying to read books, walking outside, having a home work out, eating a meal or playing a PUBG Mobile with friends.

-   🗺 Im from Benguet, Luzon, Philippines!
-   I know how to 🏊‍♀️🏊‍♂️ `swim`, 🎸 play `guitar` (a little bit), i also play 💻 `games`.
-   🙏 👆 I believe in a Creator, as I also am a creator of apps.
